# Brain-Tumor-Classification-using-Federated-Learning-Diffusion-Models-and-LLaMa
🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using Federated Learning, Diffusion Models, and LLaMa

🚀 Project Overview

Brain tumors are life-threatening conditions that require precise and early detection. This project leverages the power of Federated Learning (FL), Diffusion Models, and LLaMa (Language Model for Medical Analysis) to classify brain tumors into four categories:

Glioma Tumor

Meningioma Tumor

Pituitary Tumor

No Tumor

By combining advanced AI techniques and federated architectures, we ensure privacy, scalability, and accuracy in tumor classification, allowing for decentralized medical data processing.

🎯 Goals

Classify brain tumors using MRI scans.

Maintain data privacy with Federated Learning (FL) across multiple clients.

Enhance model accuracy with Diffusion Models for image generation and augmentation.

Use LLaMa for automated report generation and result analysis.

Provide comprehensive visualizations and evaluation metrics for monitoring performance.

🛠️ Technologies Used
